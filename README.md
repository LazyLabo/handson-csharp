## Passing multiple argumnts to program
multiple arguments, order of arguments, argument indexing 

# Modify the program so that when name was not passed, use "someone". When day of the week was not passed, use DateTime.Now

# Let's create a new program called AddIntegersApp.exe
## Takes two integer arguments and returns the sum
cast string to int, local variable, int data type, expression

# Let's create a new program called ArithmeticsApp.exe and support both "add" and "subtract"
## Takes three arguments, op, numLeft, numRight
argument types, type cast, if-else

# Let's modify the program to also support "multiply" and "devide"
## Use if-else-if-else-if-else

## if it is zero show error message "You cannot divide by 0. Please specify non-zero value"
if-statement, error handling

# Let's modify the program to use switch statement
## Use switch to handle four operators.

# Introduction to unit tests
## Create a unit test project, create a dependency to the ArithmeticsApp project
check for each op, learn that integer is whole number only, learn testing for error cases
